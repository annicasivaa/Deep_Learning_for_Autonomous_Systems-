## Assignment 1 - Semantic Segmentation of Road pixels

This repository contains the code for a semantic segmentation project focusing on road segmentation in optical images. The goal is to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow that can accurately classify each pixel in a given image as either ROAD or NO-ROAD.

### Preparation:
Before running the script, ensure that TensorFlow 2 is installed on your machine. You can follow the installation instructions at TensorFlow Installation Guide.
