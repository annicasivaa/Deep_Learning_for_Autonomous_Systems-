### Files in the Repository:
- problem_description.pdf: This document provides the task and details about the dataset (Kitti road dataset)

- train.py: This Python script is responsible for training the deep learning model. It includes placeholders for implementing the train_step and val_step functions. Additionally, the script allows you to specify the training directory to store results.

- segmentation_models.py: This script defines the model architectures, including a simple one and an incomplete U-net architecture. The completion of the U-net architecture is part of the exercise.

- data/road: This directory contains the training and test data. Training images are stored in data/road/training/image2/, and corresponding ground truth labels are in data/road/training/gt_image2/.
